# How to Solve Geometric Series Problems in Common Core Algebra 2
 
A geometric series is a sum of terms that have a common ratio between them. For example, the series 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ... is a geometric series with a common ratio of 2. Geometric series have many applications in mathematics and science, such as calculating interest, modeling population growth, and analyzing sound waves.

In Common Core Algebra 2, students learn how to find the sum of a finite geometric series using a formula, and how to determine if an infinite geometric series converges or diverges. They also learn how to use geometric series to model real-world situations and solve problems.
 
The formula for the sum of a finite geometric series is:
 
$$S\_n = \fraca\_1(1-r^n)1-r$$
 
where $S\_n$ is the sum of the first $n$ terms, $a\_1$ is the first term, and $r$ is the common ratio.
 
For example, to find the sum of the first 10 terms of the series 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ..., we can use the formula with $a\_1 = 1$, $r = 2$, and $n = 10$:
 
$$S\_10 = \frac1(1-2^10)1-2 = \frac1-1024-1 = \frac10231 = 1023$$
 
The formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series is:
 
$$S\_\infty = \fraca\_11-r$$
 
where $S\_\infty$ is the sum of the infinite series, $a\_1$ is the first term, and $r$ is the common ratio. However, this formula only works if $|r| < 1$, which means that the series converges. If $|r| \geq 1$, then the series diverges and does not have a finite sum.
 
For example, to find the sum of the infinite series $\frac13 + \frac29 + \frac427 + ...$, we can use the formula with $a\_1 = \frac13$ and $r = \frac23$:
 
$$S\_\infty = \frac\frac131-\frac23 = \frac\frac13\frac13 = 1$$
 
This means that adding infinitely many terms of this series will result in 1. However, if we try to find the sum of the infinite series 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ..., we cannot use the formula because $r = 2$ and $|r| \geq 1$. This means that the series diverges and does not have a finite sum.
 
Geometric series can also be used to model real-world situations and solve problems. For example, suppose you deposit \$1000 in a bank account that pays 5% interest compounded annually. How much money will you have after 20 years?
 
To answer this question, we can use a geometric series to represent the amount of money in the account each year. The first term is \$1000, which is the initial deposit. The second term is \$1000 plus 5% of \$1000, which is \$1050. The third term is \$1050 plus 5% of \$1050, which is \$1102.50. And so on. The common ratio between each term is 1.05, which is the factor by which the amount increases each year.
 
Therefore, we can write a geometric series for the amount of money in the account after $n$ years as:
 
$$A\_n = 1000 + 1000(1.05) + 1000(1.05)^2 + ... + 1000(1.05)^n-1$$
 
To find the amount after 20 years, we can use the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series
